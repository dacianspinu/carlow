Protesters have been holding mass rallies for nearly a week
Romania's government is to hold an urgent meeting to scrap a decree that would have shielded many politicians from prosecution for corruption.
The decree triggered the largest street protests in the country since the fall of communism in 1989.
Bowing to pressure, PM Sorin Grindeanu said on Sunday: "I do not want to divide Romania."
Tens of thousands of protesters in Bucharest cheered the move, but vowed to keep the pressure on the cabinet.
They said they would continue their rallies until the decree - which was passed on Tuesday and was due to come into effect on 10 February - was actually repealed.
Some protesters are still demanding the resignation of the entire government.
